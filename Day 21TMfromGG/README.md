- Repository: `my-task-manage-level-2`
- Type of Challenge: `learning challenge`
- Duration: `1 day`

## Mission objectives

Hello hello hello Everybody!

In this Learning challenge, your goal is simple.
First step. Be sure to have your task manager terminal code from tuesday at the ready.
if you do not have one completed or if yours is client based you can use the one provided in the manager.js file provided with this Readme (Thanks Glenn B).

The second step will be to translate this code into another language. You did it using javascript. Let's now use something else.

Everything is possible. Python, Ruby, php, ... You can choose!

Sounds Like an impossible task? I disagree. No trap. Just some translation. If you know what is a if/else in javascript looking up how to write an if/else in another language is only searching for syntax.

Do not forget that in order to run our js files we had to install ```node``` you might need to install something else to be able to run the files of language of your choice.
